# AGENTS.md — AGENTOWNERS

> This file is the canonical guide for AI agents contributing to AGENTOWNERS.
> It is designed to be machine-readable, unambiguous, and durable across model generations.

## What this project is

AGENTOWNERS is a TypeScript monorepo that ships a governance layer for AI agents in GitHub repositories:

- `@agent-owners/core` — deterministic policy engine (schema, evaluation, detection, scoring, rendering)
- `@agent-owners/cli` — `agentowners` CLI tool  
- `@agent-owners/github-action` — GitHub Action for CI enforcement

## Quickstart for agents

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pnpm install

# 2. Build all packages
pnpm build

# 3. Run all tests (must pass before any commit)
pnpm test

# 4. Type check
pnpm typecheck
```

## Decision to code: key invariants

These are immutable safety rules. Never change them:

| Invariant | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| Decision priority | `block > require_approval > allow` — always, no exceptions |
| Policy as data | Never `eval()`, `new Function()`, or execute policy content as code |
| Secret redaction | Never print matched secret values — use `[REDACTED]` |
| Determinism | Same inputs → same output. No randomness, no timestamps in evaluation |
| No database | The core engine is stateless: policy file + event context → Decision |
| Least privilege | GitHub Action never requests `repo:admin` or `secrets:read` permissions |
| Fail closed | Unknown agent defaults to `require_approval`, never silently `allow` |

## How to add a new feature

### 1. Read the spec first
Feature specs are in `docs/specs/f*.md`. The root spec is `docs/specs/readme.md`.

### 2. Follow the implementation order
Per spec section 29 — always in this order:
1. Add types to `packages/core/src/types.ts`
2. Add Zod schema to `packages/core/src/schema.ts`
3. Implement in the relevant module
4. Export from `packages/core/src/index.ts`
5. Write tests BEFORE implementing (TDD)

### 3. Add tests
- Unit test file: `packages/core/tests/<module>.test.ts`
- Integration fixture if the feature changes the evaluation pipeline
- All tests must pass: `pnpm test`

### 4. Export
Add new public exports to `packages/core/src/index.ts`.

## Adding a new policy profile

1. Add the YAML string to `packages/core/src/profiles.ts` in the `PROFILES` record
2. Add example YAML to `examples/<profile-name>/AGENTOWNERS.yml`
3. Add the profile name to the `--profile` option in `packages/cli/src/commands/init.ts`
4. Add a test in `packages/core/tests/profiles.test.ts`

## Testing philosophy

- **TDD**: write the failing test first, then implement
- **Fixtures over mocks**: use `tests/fixtures/` for integration scenarios
- **Deterministic**: tests must not depend on clock, randomness, or network
- **Coverage target**: 80%+ on `@agent-owners/core`

```bash
# Run with coverage
pnpm --filter @agent-owners/core test -- --coverage

# Run a single test file
pnpm --filter @agent-owners/core test -- packages/core/tests/evaluator.test.ts

# Run tests matching a pattern
pnpm --filter @agent-owners/core test -- --reporter verbose -t "block rule"
```

## Git workflow

```bash
# Feature branch
git checkout -b feat/my-feature

# Conventional commit format
git commit -m "feat(core): add X to Y"
git commit -m "fix(cli): handle Z edge case"
git commit -m "test(core): add coverage for W"
git commit -m "docs: update policy reference for V"
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`, `perf`, `ci`

## TypeScript rules

- `import` paths must end in `.js` (NodeNext module resolution)
- No `any` — use `unknown` and narrow safely
- Export types with `export type`, not `export`
- Keep functions under 50 lines
- Keep files under 800 lines

## Security checklist (run before every commit)

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or tokens
- [ ] Secret patterns in diff content are detected but never printed
- [ ] No `eval`, `new Function`, or dynamic `require` from policy input
- [ ] No shell execution with user-controlled strings
- [ ] GitHub Action permissions are `contents: read`, `pull-requests: write`, `issues: write` only

## What NOT to build (v1 non-goals)

Do not add these — they are explicitly out of scope for v1:

- A database or persistent state store
- A SaaS API or dashboard
- A new agent protocol or framework
- Auto-merge or `repo:admin` permissions
- Payment or billing logic

These are roadmap items for v2+ (see spec section 27).

## Common agent mistakes to avoid

1. **Import without `.js`** — NodeNext requires `./foo.js` not `./foo`
2. **Mutating `MatchedRule`** — return new objects, never mutate
3. **Changing decision priority** — `block > require_approval > allow` is immutable
4. **Printing secret values** — always redact with `[REDACTED]`
5. **Adding network calls to `@agent-owners/core`** — core is pure/stateless
6. **Skipping barrel export** — always add new exports to `src/index.ts`

## Roadmap hooks (design for these, don't build yet)

Future features that current code should not break:

- **v1.1**: GitHub App webhook mode, label application, reviewer request
- **v1.2**: Agent self-check CLI command, SARIF output format
- **v2**: Signed agent manifests, org-level policy inheritance, GitLab support

Keep these in mind when making architectural decisions.
